The Elo Rating system, first developed for rating chess players, is a common rating system used across competitive events such as basketball, football, go and scrabble.

This project seeks to investigate the effectiveness of elo ratings (of basketball teams) as a predictive measure of the outcome of a game as against home court advantage. 

### Data Preparation

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#setup packages
if("dplyr" %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) {install.packages("dplyr")}
library(dplyr)
if("ggplot2" %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) {install.packages("ggplot2")}
library(ggplot2)


# load data

URL_nba_elo <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/nba-elo/nbaallelo.csv"

nba_data <- read.csv(URL_nba_elo) 
nbadata <-  filter(nba_data,X_iscopy == 0)

nbadata2 <- filter(nba_data, game_location == 'H')
nbadata3 <- filter(nba_data, game_location == 'A')

index <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), length(nba_data), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.5,0.5))
nbadata2_a <- nbadata2[index,]
nbadata2_b <- nbadata2[!index,]


index <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), length(nba_data), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.5,0.5))
nbadata3_a <- nbadata3[index,]
nbadata3_b <- nbadata3[!index,]

sampleA <- rbind(nbadata2_a, nbadata3_a)
sampleB <- rbind(nbadata2_b, nbadata2_b)
3
```
The project will use sample A

### Research question 

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**

Which is a better predictor of whether a team will win a basketball game: elo rating of the competing teams or home court advantage?



### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**
Each case represents a game played by a basketball team.  There are 126314 cases.  These cases represent `r 126314/2` games since there will be two cases per game (one for each team competing in the game).
 

### Data collection 

**Describe the method of data collection.**
The data was compiled by fivethirtyeight.com from  the third party source http://www.basketball-reference.com/.


### Type of study 

**What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?**

This is an observational study.

### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**

The Complete History of the NBA by Ruben Fischer-Baum and Nate Silver (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nba/#spurs)

The data can be accessed here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-elo


### Response 

**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**

The response variable is game_result: whether the team won/loss.  It is categorical.


### Explanatory 

**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**

The explanatory variables are:

1. elo_i: The elo rating of the team before the game. It is numerical
2. opp_elo_i: The elo rating of the oposing team before the game.  It is numerical
3. game_location: Whether the game was an away game or home game.  It is categorical



### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**

####game_result
```{r}
table(sampleA$game_result, useNA = 'ifany')
prop.table(table(sampleA$game_result, useNA='ifany')) * 100

```

####game_location

```{r}
table(sampleA$game_location, useNA = 'ifany')
prop.table(table(sampleA$game_location, useNA='ifany')) * 100

```

####Location vs. Result

```{r}
table(sampleA$game_location, sampleA$game_result)
```



#### elo_i

```{r}
summary(sampleA$elo_i)

```



```{r}
ggplot(sampleA, aes(x=elo_i)) + geom_histogram(fill="white", colour="black") + facet_grid(game_result ~.)
```

#### opp_elo_i
```{r}
summary(sampleA$opp_elo_i)
```

```{r}
ggplot(sampleA, aes(x=opp_elo_i)) + geom_histogram(fill="white", colour="black") + facet_grid(game_result ~.)
```


####elo_i vs opp_elo_i
```{r}
plot(sampleA$elo_i, sampleA$opp_elo_i)
```


```{r}
ggplot(sampleA, aes(x=elo_i, y=opp_elo_i)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(game_result ~ .)
```
